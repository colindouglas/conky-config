# Overview

This is my personal configuration for [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky). It contains a couple extra helper scripts

* **plex-now-playing.py** authorizes with a local Plex server, and prints a list of the current streams
* **oneline-cronlog.py** prints recent cron jobs in a pleasing format
